## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

In this section I decided to use data from blah blah
#want to see not run use r, eval = FALSE, echo FALSE (hides the code true lets us see the code)
#make it add figure captions using fig.captions
#library (here) when you want to put your data into Rmarkdown and it can't find it. 
```{r}
x <- 1:100
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(y~x)
```
